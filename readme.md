# Discord FAQ

## Channel Organization

Feel free to create other channels. I think everyone should have permissions to. When creating, you can choose if you want it be private or not and only invite some members.

## Forum Channels

Forum channels are like classic forums from back in the day. Use these for instances where discussion is not time-sensitive. Like for GSD, tool recommendations or how to do a particular project/task.

## Threads

Threads can be perfect for events like a sporting event: something that is transient and discussion isn't super intersting beyond a few days.

Threads will show in a particular channel's child structure but will disappear from here after 24 hours of no messages. I believe they can still be found, though.

## Pinned Messages
View pinned messages. Click on the pin in the upper right. Let me know if you want a particular message pinned. Useful for things people might want to be able to reference for some period of time. Pinned messages can be unpinned. Just let me know.
